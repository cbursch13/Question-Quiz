create all the variables for each part (questions, timer, score)
use event listener to start the timer when we click the start button
count the timer down from the amount of time we start it at (10 seconds for the number of questions)
use render to stop when timer hits zero
every question wrong take off 10 seconds from the timer
create an array of questions and make the choices be arrays that we can choose the correct answer and then reference back to
choose first item in the array of questions
Create new elements in html file for questions to appear on screen 
use a for loop to cycle through each question
use event listeners to see which answer was chosen and compare event with correct answer if statement to add points score and else statement to subtract time from timer using penalty variable 
track where you at in the for loop of questions
when questions are finished append a message to html saying all done!
show score of user
display a button to enter using add to document
have user enter score into box with initials
save event of entering information and sent to local storage
